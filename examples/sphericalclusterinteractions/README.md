This example builds a standalone APECSS code for a spherical cluster of 2500 bubbles (the number can be modified in the [.c source file](./build/sphericalclusterinteractions_apecss)) interacting with each other using the quasi acoustic interaction model and excited by a sinusoidal propagating wave (propagating along the x-axis from negative to positive values). This example is inspired by one of the first clusters presented in [Maeda, K., & Colonius, T. (2019). Bubble cloud dynamics in an ultrasound field. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 862, 1105â€‘1134](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2018.968). In order to optimize computational costs, parallelization is used. The computation took around 4 complete days (96 hours) by running on 15 cores from a 13th Gen Intel i7-13700K x24. The results displayed at the end are the global cluster evolution at different times and the averaged radius evolution of bubbles depending on their location inside the cluster.
