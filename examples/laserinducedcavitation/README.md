This example builds a standalone APECSS code for a laser-induced cavitation bubble, based on the modified Gilmore model presented by [Liang et al., _J. Fluid Mech._ 940 (2022), A5](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2022.202). To this end, the modified Gilmore ODE for the bubble radius, the second-order model describing the particle velocity as a result of the initial shock-driven acceleration of the bubble wall following the adsorption of the laser pulse in water, as well as functions defining a time-dependent equilibrium radius and the gas pressure based on the equilibrium radius, are included in this example. The provided [run.apecss](./run.apecss) file reproduces the bubble dynamics shown in Figs. 7 and 8, and the acoustic emissions at selected time instances shown in Fig. 10, of the paper of Liang et al. using the following execution command: ````./build/lic_apecss -options run.apecss -tend 12e-6````.
