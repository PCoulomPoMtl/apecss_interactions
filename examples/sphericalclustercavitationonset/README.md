This example builds a standalone APECSS code for a cluster of 2500 interacting bubbles. The cluster can be monodispersed (with 10.0 microns as bubbles initial radius) or polydispersed (with the radii distribution following a log normal law such as $ln(R/R_{0,ref}) \sim N(0,0.7)$, with $R_{0,ref} = 10.0$ microns, as described in [Maeda, K., & Colonius, T. (2019). Bubble cloud dynamics in an ultrasound field. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 862, 1105â€‘1134](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2018.968)). The excitation wave is the same as the one described in [Ida, M. (2009). Multibubble cavitation inception. Physics of Fluids, 21(11), 113302.](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3265547) and used in the example "cavitationonset". The computations can be done using the _standard incompressible model_ ("IC") or the newly developped _quasi acoustic model_ (QA). Since the latter one is a preatty heavy computation, parallelization using *OpenMPI* is adopted (around hours/days on 15 cores of an Intel i7-13700K x24 processor). Concerning the displayed results, the bubbles in the monodispersed cluster are studied based on their location in the cluster (like the "sphericalclusterinteractions" example), while for the polydispersed one, a repartition based on their initial radius is considered.
