This example builds a standalone APECSS code for a 51x51 finite bubbly screen of interacting microbubbles, inspired by [Fan, Y., Li, H., & Fuster, D. (2021). Time-delayed interactions on acoustically driven bubbly screens. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 150(6), 4219â€‘4231.](https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0008905). Two interaction type are considered : either the _standard incompressible model_ ("IC") or the newly developped _quasi acoustic model_ ("QA"). In order to optimize computational costs, the quasi acoustic computations are run by using parallelization. The computations are quite heavy because steady state must be achieved, leading to large enough computed times (IC interactions are taking around an hour for 35 microseconds of computed times, while it's around with 15 cores of an Intel 13th gen I7 13700K x24). The displayed results are for each excitation frequency tested the normalized radius oscillation amplitude of each bubble in steady state.
