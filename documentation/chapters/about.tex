\chapter{About APECSS}

APECSS is a software tool to compute pressure-driven bubble dynamics and the resulting acoustic emissions. It is written exclusively in C and has been developed with simplicity, versatility and performance in mind. The acronym APECSS stands for "Acoustic Pulse Emitted by Cavitation in Spherical Symmetry".

APECSS is under the copyright of its developers and made available as open-source software under the terms of the [Mozilla Public License Version 2.0](LICENSE.txt).

The development of APECSS has directly benefitted from research funding provided by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), grant number 441063377.
