\chapter{About APECSS}

APECSS is a software tool to compute pressure-driven bubble dynamics and the resulting acoustic emissions. It is written exclusively in {\tt C} and has been developed with simplicity, versatility and performance in mind. The acronym APECSS stands for "Acoustic Pulse Emitted by Cavitation in Spherical Symmetry".

The main features of APECSS are:\vspace{-1em}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Bubble dynamics using widely-used models for the bubble dynamics (Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis, Gilmore).
\item Acoustic emissions of the bubble under different assumptions (incompressible, quasi-acoustic, fully compressible).
\item Prediction of the formation and attenuation of shock fronts emitted by the bubble.
\item Viscoelastic media (Kelvin-Voigt, Zener, Oldroyd-B).
\item Lipid monolayer coating of the bubble as used for ultrasound contrast agents.
\item All ODEs are solved with an in-built fifth-order Runge-Kutta scheme with fourth-order error estimate, based on \citet{Dormand1980}.
\item APECSS has no external dependencies, aside from the standard {\it math} library and some common {\tt C} headers (math.h, stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h).
\end{itemize}

The APECSS repository is located at \href{https://github.com/polycfd/apecss}{\texttt{https://github.com/polycfd/apecss}} and structured as follows:\vspace{-1em}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item The {\tt documentation/} folder contains this short documentation of APECSS.
    \item The {\tt examples/} folder contains representative examples of how to use APECSS and to demonstrate the most important features of APECSS. 
    \item The {\tt include/} folder contains the {\tt apecss.h} header file, in which all variables, macros and functions of APECSS are defined.
    \item The {\tt lib/} folder in which the APECSS library is compiled (at least if you follow the installation instructions in Section \ref{sec:installation}).
    \item The {\tt src/} folder contains all source files ({\tt *.c}) of APECSS.
    \item The {\tt .clang-format} file, which defines the formatting rules for the source code, see Section \ref{sec:clang}.
    \item The {\tt .gitignore} file telling \textit{git} which folders and files to ignore.
    \item The {\tt LICENSE.txt} file containing the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0.
    \item The {\tt README.md} file with the most important information about APECSS.
